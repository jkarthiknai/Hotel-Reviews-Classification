Project Purpose: This project is used to classify truthful and deceptive hotel reviews.

Data file required: op_spam_v1.4.zip
This file has 2 folders negative_polarity and positive_polarity.
  1. Each of these 2 folders have deceptive and truthful level-2 folders
  2. Each of these level-2 folders have 5 level-3 folders named fold1, fold2, fold3, fold4 & fold5 (20 folders in total).
  3. Each of these level-2 folders have 80 hotel reviews (1600 reviews in total).

There are 2 python notebooks, 1st for performing EDA and the 2nd for classification:
  1. EDA_Truthful_Deceptive_Hotel_Reviews.ipynb explores the data and creates Hotel_Reviews_EDA.csv. There are 3 other intermediate folders created.
  2. Truthful_Deceptive_Hotel_Reviews.ipynb classifies the reviews with the Hotel_Reviews_EDA.csv.

Cleaned_Hotel_Reviews_Generated.csv (generated by a transformer) is not required to perform EDA, but required to run the script.
